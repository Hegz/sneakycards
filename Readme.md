Sneaky Cards
===========

"The Sneaky Card" is a concept created by Harry Lee described as  "Experimental game-cards that provoke social interaction."

Sneaky cards is a continuation of that experiment.  It's currently undergoing a 
social development at http://www.reddit.com/r/sneakycards/. This repository was
put together as a way to get the cards and ideas out to the public at large, 
and get people playing this wonderful game.

As this is still in development, some of the cards available may seem a little
odd, out of place, or poorly worded.

In keeping with the original creators principals, this repository of files and ideas 
will always be free to reproduce, remix, or use for whatever purpose.
